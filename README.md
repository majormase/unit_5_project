# unit_5_project

My unit 5 project was centered around a previous desire to build a music portfolio when I was a professional composer. My site allows an admin to login and submit information containing a title, description, link and image. A user can also write comments for each entry to give their feedback. My site contains the CSS framework, milligram, and custom CSS workings as well.
